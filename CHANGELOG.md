- Added proprietary license — usage requires a valid commercial license from valantic CEC Deutschland GmbH

## 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- **FastMCP 2.x CLI compatibility** - Updated Dockerfile to use file path syntax (`src/workoflow_mcp/server.py:mcp`) instead of module path syntax which FastMCP 2.x no longer supports
- **Relative imports error** - Changed imports in server.py from relative (`from .cache`) to absolute (`from workoflow_mcp.cache`) to work with FastMCP's direct file execution
- **Docker container network access** - Added `--host 0.0.0.0` to allow connections from outside the container
- **Health check** - Changed from HTTP endpoint check to TCP socket check since FastMCP doesn't expose `/health`

### Changed
- **SSE transport** - Switched from `http` to `sse` transport for better compatibility with MCP clients like Claude Desktop via mcp-remote
- **Package installation** - Now uses `pip install .` with pyproject.toml instead of requirements.txt for proper package installation
